# voxelwise_u-test
Tests for each voxel within a specified region of interest (ROI) whether the signal during stimulation differed from the signal during rest periods.

# Overview
The Voxelwise u-test was programmed for the analysis of functional MRI data. It allows model-free identification of voxels that are activated during an applied stimulation paradigm. For this purpose, the dataset under investigation as well as information on the paradigm used must be provided as input. The user can then mark an ROI, in which the programme checks voxel by voxel whether the signal at stimulation differs significantly from the signal at rest using a u-test. <br>
A detailed description of the voxelwise u-test is available at <br>
